Note: This module is no longer needed, as the functions physenv.Set/GetPhysicsPaused have been added to GMOD (only in the dev version for now)

This module is simply re-uploaded. I don't know who is the original author of this binary module.

## Functions:

### GetShouldSimulate()
Returns a boolean which means whether physics should be simulated

### SetShouldSimulate(bool)
Enable/disable physics simulation (physenv.GetLastSimulationTime gets frozen when stopped)
